# Project: KeepItOn_Python_Analysis
  - Data Analysis using Python (Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib).
  
## The Context:
Access Now is a growing international human rights organization dedicated to defending and extending the digital rights of users at risk around the world. This task falls within the #KeepItOn campaign, a global initiative to end internet shutdowns through advocacy, documentation and monitoring, direct policy-maker engagement, strategic litigation among others.

## About the Project:
The aim of this project is to analyse a database consisting on internet access shut downs around the world.

# The tasks for analysis were:

Task 1: Here is the 2020 STOP database and the latest methodology. Please tell us in bullet sentences some differences of shutdown cases between India and Belarus. 
(Consider: who ordered the shutdowns?  What are the unique traits of these shutdowns?  What communities are impacted? How are they impacted?)

Task 2: There is a tweet report that a mobile network shutdown is ongoing in Niger right after its 2021 residential election. How would you proceed to verify this claim? (Please list any kind of evidence you think would be key to verify this shutdown and a plan to get them.)

Task 3: Here is the current STOP data intake form. Please go through the form and name any question that can be improved in your view as well as improvement suggestions.

# Description:

The 'KeepItOn_Data_Analysis.ipynb' file contains the code to answer the questions above.

The 'KeepItOn-STOP-Data-20202.csv' is tha database utilized for the analysis.

The 'KeepItOn_CLeanedData.csv' file contains the database data cleaned.
