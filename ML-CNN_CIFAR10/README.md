## About the Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for the classification of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies these images into their respective categories.

## Task

The task involves solving a more challenging problem of a multi-class classification problem using image inputs from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The objective is to develop a methodical and scientifically grounded approach to creating neural network models capable of accurately classifying images into multiple categories. This entails experimenting with various network types, architecture choices, hyper-parameter optimization techniques, and dimensionality reduction methods.

## Future Improvements

- Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Instead of manually tuning hyperparameters, consider implementing automated hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Tools like scikit-learn's GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV, as well as libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt, can efficiently search the hyperparameter space to find optimal configurations, saving time and potentially improving model performance.

- Ensemble Learning: Implement ensemble learning techniques to combine predictions from multiple models. This could involve training multiple CNN architectures with different hyperparameters or using techniques like bagging or boosting. By combining the strengths of different models, ensemble learning often leads to improved performance and robustness.

- Transfer Learning: Explore the use of transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception. Instead of training your CNN architectures from scratch, you can initialize the networks with pre-trained weights learned from large-scale image datasets like ImageNet. Fine-tuning these pre-trained models on the CIFAR-10 dataset can lead to faster convergence and potentially better performance, especially when dealing with limited training data.
