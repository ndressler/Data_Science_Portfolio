## The Context:

Access Now is a growing international human rights organization dedicated to defending and extending the digital rights of users at risk around the world. This task falls within the #KeepItOn campaign, a global initiative to end internet shutdowns through advocacy, documentation and monitoring, direct policy-maker engagement, strategic litigation among others.

## About the Project:

The "KeepItOn" project is a comprehensive analysis of internet access shutdowns around the world, conducted in support of the #KeepItOn campaign led by Access Now, an international human rights organization dedicated to defending digital rights. Leveraging Python programming language and popular data science libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the phenomenon of internet shutdowns through meticulous data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and task completion.

## Tasks for Analysis:

### Task 1:
In bullet sentences, describe some differences of shutdown cases between India and Belarus:
- Who ordered the shutdowns?
- What are the unique traits of these shutdowns?
- What communities are impacted?
- How are they impacted?

### Task 2:
There is a tweet report that a mobile network shutdown is ongoing in Niger right after its 2021 residential election. How would you proceed to verify this claim? Provide a list of evidence and a plan to obtain them.
