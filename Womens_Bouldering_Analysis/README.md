# Project: Womens_Bouldering_Analysis
  - Data Analysis (EDA) using Google Sheets and Slides.
 
## About the Project:
The purpose of this project is to explore the data concerning the women's bouldering world cups of the last 5 years, 
the data used is from 2016 to 2021 and was scraped from the IFSC website. Furthermore, main aim of the project is to show the complete process of analysis.  
*The year of 2020 held no competitions by cause of the COVID pandemic.

Bouldering is an explosive performance on routes (problems) with a maximum height of 4 metres and safety mats below. 
The athlete who solves the most problems in the lowest number of attempts wins.

The project was divided in the following phases:

I. Scrapping the raw data and cleaning (raw_data, clean_data and ultimately DATA sheet);<br>
II. Widely analysing the data and concentrating the findings (ANALYSIS); and later working on the visualization (GRAPHS);<br>
III. Summarizing main insights and findings of the analysis performed on a project presentation.

# Description:

The 'WOMENS_BOULDERING_Spreadsheet.xlsx' file is a spreadsheet containing the raw data obtained from the 
<a href="https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/world-competition/last-result" target="_blank"> IFSC</a>'s website. 
The data was then cleaned and manipulated.<br>
This file also contains all of the analysis, all the formulas as well as graphs for visualization.

The 'WOMENS_BOULDERING_Slides.pptx' file is a slides presentation of the analysis. The 'WOMENS_BOULDERING_Slides.pdf' file is the same as the pptx but in another format.
